=== SCHEDULING TASKS ===

Schedule the following tasks on the following servers:


Primary Production

1. Dripper.cfm
2. enotify.cfm
3. enotify-step-2-send,cfm
4. follow-up-reminder.cfm

Linux Server

1. popper.cfm
2. popper-bbc.cfm


--- Need to figure out how to recode these pages to run on task server. Unfornately we are including mls/includes files, so to move tasks to the tasks server, we are risking not having changes being updated properly.
