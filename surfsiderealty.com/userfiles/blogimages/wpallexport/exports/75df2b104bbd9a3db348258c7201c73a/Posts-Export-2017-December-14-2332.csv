13,"Advantages of Choosing Second Row Vacation Rentals","Many people coming to the beach want their accommodations to be as close to the ocean as they possibly can be. They look for oceanfront rentals and they pay a premium price for them. While we certainly understand the desire to be up close and personal with the ocean as well as to have unobstructed views, have you considered the benefits of staying in our second or third row vacation rentals in Surfside Beach?

One of the biggest advantages to staying a bit further from the oceanfront is price. You can save a lot by being located just a few yards further from the oceanfront and, in many cases, you still have a wonderful view. These homes are located in neighborhoods offering places to walk and bike and some <img src=""/userfiles/image/2ndRowSurfsideRental.jpg"" alt=""Surfside Beach SC vacation rentals"" width=""225"" height=""183"" align=""right"" border=""0"" hspace=""10"" vspace=""10"" />communities also offer additional benefits such as clubhouses, tennis, shuffleboard, and a playground for the kids. These second and third row home rentals offer more privacy, security, and you won’t find people playing in your front yard.

14,"Cure Those Winter Blues with a Visit to the Grand Strand Area","If you’re looking for an antidote to the winter blues we have it right here in coastal South Carolina! Many people find it necessary to escape the cold and snow each year during those long winter months if only for a week. Often times it’s just what they need to recharge them enough to get through the rest of the season. For others, they come for one to three months and return after the snow melts.

<img src=""/userfiles/image/77738880.jpg"" alt=""Grand Strand vacation home rentals can relieve those winter blues"" width=""250"" height=""213"" align=""left"" border=""0"" hspace=""10"" vspace=""10"" />What we can tell you is that we have many comfortable <a style=""text-decoration: none; color: black; font-weight: normal;"" href=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/Grand-Strand-vacation-rentals.cfm"" target=""_blank"">Grand Strand vacation home rentals</a> that will begin lifting your spirits from the moment you walk through the front door. There are plenty of oceanfront rentals that will provide you with the opportunity to catch a sunrise from your deck every morning while having breakfast and it only gets better from there.

We know it’s difficult for many people living in the northern states to endure those long winter months and it seems like the older you are, the harder it becomes. In many states it’s rare that people ever see the sun during this time of year and many times when it is out it’s too cold to even go outdoors to enjoy it. In coastal South Carolina the sun seems to almost always be shining and the temperatures are a long ways from cold. We’d like to invite you to come treat yourself to a stay in any one of our <a style=""text-decoration: none; color: black; font-weight: normal;"" href=""http://goo.gl/XbtFXW"" target=""_blank"">Grand Strand vacation home rentals</a>.

It’s a known fact that moods are significantly lifted when you get adequate sun. Some people use “Sun Boxes” and while it helps it doesn’t come with a beautiful sandy beach to walk or all the championship golf courses and shopping malls we have here in the Grand Strand region.

<img src=""/userfiles/image/ishot-8(2).jpg"" alt=""Grand Strand vacation home rentals"" width=""128"" height=""185"" align=""right"" border=""0"" hspace=""10"" vspace=""0"" />Don’t settle for imitation sunshine when South Carolina is so close. The weather is so temperate that you can walk the beaches, go bicycling, and hit the golf courses any time of the year. Those are the very things that will lift your spirits and put you in a good mood. Maybe that explains why so many people relocate to this area after retiring and are always happy they did so.

Medically, it’s true that sunshine is essential for our physical and emotional well-being. Sunshine encourages our body to release serotonin, a chemical derived from the amino acids in our body’s tissues, and that significantly improves our mood. It’s also our body’s main source of Vitamin D, which is essential for strong teeth and bones and the older you get the more important this is.

When the sun is out and the temperatures are warmer, you’re more likely to want to go outside and do things. In this area there are many things to do outdoors, too, things like playing golf, walking the beach, shopping, visiting museums and local parks, gardens, and many historic landmarks. All these things can contribute to an increased feeling of well-being.

If you’d like to experience an increase in your mood irst hand, why not come and visit us in coastal South Carolina. We promise you won’t run out of things to do while you’re here and you’re going to feel a whole lot better. Take a look at the vacation home rentals we have on our website and if you have any questions just give us a call at 1-866-252-9930.

The money you save, the privacy you&apos;ll enjoy and the great experience you&apos;ll have will likely change the way you travel forever. <a href=""http://Surfside Beach SC rentals - L http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/surfside-beach-sc-rentals.cfm"">Surfside Beach SC rentals</a> are the best and we&rsquo;re not just saying that. But for you to have the greatest vacation of your life try to avoid these common pitfalls.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 1 - Making Your Reservation at the Last Minute</strong><br />
The longer you wait to reserve a rental the higher the risk of having to settle for a home no one else wants. Do you have your heart set on coming a certain week? Then make your reservations early!</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 2 - Neglecting to Check the Weather</strong><br />
What will the weather be like where you&apos;re going? In tropical locations the rainy season may have warm and sunny days with showers in the late afternoon. One perk of off-season travel is the rates are cheaper and the weather more temperate.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 3 - Failure to Ask for Details</strong><br />
Is the neighborhood noisy? Are housekeeping services included or are they a separate fee? Does the price include taxes? How big are the rooms? Don&apos;t rely on photos alone. When in doubt, ask.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 4 - Not Fully Exploring Your Online Resources</strong><br />
Be sure to look at photos of the vacation rental online. Read testimonials posted from previous guests. Check out the additional links many sites post for things to do in the area while you&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 5 - Not Trusting Your Gut Feelings</strong><br />
Are you not &quot;clicking&quot; with the homeowner or rental agent? Are you getting vague answers to your questions? At <a href=""http://Surfside Beach SC rentals - L http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/surfside-beach-sc-rentals.cfm""><strong>Seaside Rentals Online</strong></a> we listen to what you say when you tell us about your ideal rental and we work hard to find it for you.

Call ahead and ask when making reservations. Some properties do charge a small additional fee for pets staying in the rental. This is understandable when considering the time involved in cleaning pet hair from the furniture.</p>
<p>If your pet is accustomed to having a special bed or blanket to sleep on, then bring it along. This makes your pet feel more &quot;at home&quot; and comfortable in the new surroundings. Pets know where they are supposed to lie down because they have their familiar item to designate the space that is &quot;theirs.&quot; If your pets are crate trained, you have the perfect &quot;luggage&quot; to bring along.</p>

From live entertainment to water parks and amusement parks, as well as the specialty shopping outlets, over 100 championship golf courses, and over 1,800 restaurants, Myrtle Beach&nbsp; is teaming with things to do and see.</p>
<p>In the area known as the Grand Strand you&apos;ll find Huntington Beach State Park. It is located in historic Murrells Inlet and is just a short distance from Brookgreen Gardens. Here you&apos;ll find the sprawling Spanish-style castle known as Atalaya. This castle used to be the winter home and studio for the American sculptor, Anna Hyatt Huntington and her husband, Philanthropist Archer Huntington. It is here that several of Anna Huntington&apos;s sculptures still remain, like the incredible Diana of the Hunt. Your <a href=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/south-carolina-vacations.cfm"">South Carolina vacation</a> won&apos;t be complete until you walk the grounds of Brookgreen Gardens.

Taking vacations is known to be good for you mental health. We all need to take a break from our everyday lives and jobs once in a while and treat ourselves to a relaxing escape. With the summer season upon us, spending a day soaking up the sun on the beach sounds like a pretty appealing way to spend a vacation. Here are some of our favorite health benefits of a beach vacation:
<ol>
	<li>Improve your mood: Spending time in the sunshine can increase your brain’s production of serotonin, the anti-depressant “feel-good” hormone that your body naturally creates. Also, soaking up some vitamin D can reduce the risk of heart problems.</li>
	<li>Get active: Renting a beach house near the ocean provides you with plenty of opportunity to take an invigorating morning run, or a relaxing evening stroll.

278,"How to Choose the Right Winter Rental in South Carolina","If you’re thinking about spending the long cold winter months somewhere that the weather is more temperate this year, where the temperatures allow for year round golf and long walks on the beach, why not come to coastal South Carolina and spend the winter.  At <a title=""Winter Rentals in Surfside Beach and Garden City Beach SC"" href=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/winter-rentals"" target=""_blank"">Seaside Rentals</a> we have a large assortment of single family homes in Surfside Beach and Garden City Beach that will afford you all the comforts of home plus a whole lot more. This area of the South Carolina coastline is not as crowded as it is further north in Myrtle Beach and beyond. It’s a quieter, more family-friendly place to stay. It’s a toasty location to spend those long winter months!

<a href=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SnowyHouse.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-279"" src=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SnowyHouse.jpg"" alt=""How to leave your home in the winter"" width=""727"" height=""482"" /></a>

<strong>How to Leave Your Home</strong>

For those who have never left their home for an extended period of time to spend the winter in a warmer environment, it’s easier than you may think.
<ol>
	<li>Hire a house sitter to come stay in your home while you’re away. They’ll water the plants, shovel the snow, send you your mail and make sure your home is secure and looks occupied.</li>
	<li>You can rent a bedroom or the entire home out, fully furnished, to someone for a short stay or on a temporary basis. The want ads in the local newspapers and on Craig’s List are full of people looking. Be sure to check potential tenants out well.</li>
	<li>Why not advertise your home for rent to someone looking to spend their winters up north. Yeah, there really <em>are</em> people like that in the world!</li>
	<li>You can leave your home empty. Turn the heat down low, the water off and unplug the appliances. Put some lights on a timer and arrange to have someone come by, perhaps a family member or neighbor, to check on the home periodically. You’ll need to arrange to have someone do snow removal for you while you’re away as well. And don't forget to forward your mail and newspaper!</li>
</ol>

<strong>Where to Spend the Winter</strong>

You don’t have to drive the whole way to Florida to spend the winter months anymore. There are other closer places that should be considered and plenty of reasons why.
<ol>
	<li>South Carolina is very pleasant during the winter months and there’s no snow to shovel.</li>
	<li>Golf courses around the Grand Strand (the area of Myrtle Beach, Surfside Beach and Garden City Beach) are open year round and there won’t be a lot of people on the courses to navigate around as there are in the peak summer months.</li>
	<li>Coming to SC for the winter will save you tons of gas and time over going as far south as Florida.</li>
	<li>Our Surfside Beach and Garden City Beach winter rentals will cost you less and come with awesome amenities that you’re sure to enjoy.</li>

<strong>Things To Do Around Coastal SC</strong>

No matter where you stay you’ll be close to a vast number of local events taking place in the area. There’s never a shortage of things to do here.

1. Be sure to visit the <a title=""Brookgreen Gardens"" href=""http://www.brookgreen.org/"" target=""_blank"">Brookgreen Gardens</a> in Murrells Inlet. This seaside community is also known as the <em>“Seafood Capital of South Carolina”</em> so it’s worth stopping off to have dinner while you’re in the area.

2. Have some laughs at <a href=""http://big-laughs.com/"">Big Laughs Theatre</a>, 2696 Beaver Run Blvd., Surfside Beach. Choose from Mild Family Show – a rock ‘n roll comedy hypnosis show, Wild &amp; Crazy Adult Comedy Hypnosis Show, or the Fusion Hypnosis Show.

3. Group Dance Lessons at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LetsDanceDebra"">Let’s Dance Studio</a>, 5221 N. Kings Hwy., Myrtle Beach. Come out and learn Ballroom, Salsa, Bachata, Shag, Swing, Tango and more taught in groups. No partner necessary!

4. Take in an exciting football game at <a href=""http://www.goccusports.com/"">Coastal Carolina University</a> in nearby Conway, SC. This is the perfect time of the year for it!

Whether this is your first time spending winter away from home and you’re planning a trip for just a month to try it out, for three months as most of the “snowbirds” do, or you want to spend the entire winter from November through April, we’re sure to be able to provide you with the perfect winter rental for your stay. Call us at 866-252-9930 if we can help you with your reservations or answer any questions you may have.

While it doesn't seem real, 2014 is almost over. The holiday season is fast approaching and that means getting all the family together.  Calls will be placed; messages will be posted trying to choose which ""lucky"" family member's home to invade. A lively debate will ensue and pretty soon someone is calling aunt Lisa's chicken salad, ""dry."" The truth is, nobody particularly enjoys the stresses that come with the holidays.

<span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>1. No Snow</strong></span> - Imagine waking up on Christmas morning. A fresh coat snow has fallen overnight. The world is a beautiful white wash. Now remember that you have to drive 20 minutes over to grandma's house. Who is going to shovel? Are you prepared for yet another year of shoveling just to leave the house? If you've ever lived where it snows annually then you know that the beauty of fresh snow lasts for a mere moment while the cold, poor road conditions and not so sunny disposition can last all winter. Did we mention the cold? December is freezing north of Virginia.

&nbsp;

Now imagine waking up on Christmas morning.  The sound of crashing waves are echoing off the walls because you chose to leave the door open last night. Oh yeah, and you got the big room.  The best present one can receive is the ability to make everlasting memories  with family. A close second is not having to shovel snow. This holiday season, why not try a new spin on the scenery? A beach house on Christmas morning sure sounds nice.

&nbsp;

<span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>2. Less Crowded</strong></span> - Summertime and the beach go hand in hand. A time to beat the summer heat by scrambling to find parking, jockeying for a spot on the sand and listening to someone else's blaring radio. Fortunately, this is not true during the rest of the year. With the sun still gleaming and ocean still roaring,  larger crowds and noise pollution are all but eliminated.  You are free to listen to the sea as it was intended to be heard. During the offseason, far more fully intact shells and sand dollars can be found while combing the area beaches.

&nbsp;

<span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>3. More Affordable</strong></span> - If there was ever a time to  celebrate in an oceanfront home for less, this would be that time. Vacation rentals are designed with families in mind to accommodate larger parties. Beat the peak season prices and still get the entire family experience at the beach this year. Discounts, specials and reduced holiday rates are rampant so don't be afraid to call and ask about any additional offers.

&nbsp;

<span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>4. Not Your House</strong></span> - Family in your house is great, right? Just until about hour 14 and you realize housework just tripled this week.  A vacation home not only gets your family out of your place but maybe, just maybe, you'll get to enjoy yourself too. Nevermind dirtying your own house this year. Tell everyone, ""See you all at the beach.""

&nbsp;

<span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>5. Family Experience</strong></span> - What an amazing time the holidays are. A chance for aunts, grandparents and newborns to all share life moments with one another. How great would it be to watch the little ones run on the sand? These are memories and moments meant to be experienced and shared for a lifetime.  How about a family Christmas photo with everyone and the beach as the backdrop? Now that would make a great Christmas card for next year!

<ol>

	<li>At the top of the list has to be a gift certificate from <strong>Seaside Rentals</strong> for a stay in one of our many vacation rentals.</li>
	<li>With Myrtle Beach being the <em>Golf Capital of the U.S.</em> you’ll be able to find anything golf related that you may dream up. There are many specialty golf stores where just browsing through will give you plenty of ideas.</li>

<li>For all those perfect shells you never stay long enough to find, check out one of the specialty shell shops either in the Surfside Beach area or head down to the boardwalk in Myrtle Beach where you’ll find anything and everything made of seashells.</li>
	<li>If your gift recipient is coming for a vacation to the area soon, why not give a gift certificate to one of the local restaurants. With close to 2,000 restaurants in the Grand Strand area alone, you’re sure to find one that appeals to them.</li>
	<li>What woman wouldn’t love a scarf, wrap or shawl. Head on over to one of the larger stores in the mall and if you’re unsure what to get, just ask a store associate to assist you. Women give great recommendations on gifts for other women.</li><center><a href=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/slippers.jpg""><img src=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/slippers.jpg"" alt=""Great Ideas for Holiday Gift Giving This Year"" width=""700"" height=""464"" class=""size-full wp-image-433"" /></a></center>
<li>At this time of the year slippers are always a welcomed gift no matter where you live! Those in the north need warmer lined slippers but around the coast unlined slippers will be just perfect.</li>
	<li>For that fellow on your list that appears to have everything, he’s sure to appreciate some lightweight lounging pants made of pima cotton or flannel. A tough sell you think? Then get him the silk ones!</li>
	<li>While we’re on the subject of comfort – Just about everyone could use a robe! Whether they’re lounging around on a Sunday morning not quite ready to get dressed or they just climbed out of the shower, it’s a can’t-miss gift for this holiday.</li>

<li>With everyone using some type of mobile device there are lots of accessories on the market today that you can select from. You just can’t have enough rechargeable cables and plugs. Or how about a specialty case for that cell phone. Just browse around any electronic section of nearly any store and you’ll come up with a large number of items that would be ideal gifts.

560,"Check Out These Dog Friendly Vacation Rentals","Dog owners across the country understand the pang of guilt experienced when it comes to boarding their pets. While friends try to help and tell you that pets consider the boarding facility: a “vacation”, “summer camp”, and just a cool opportunity to hang out with other canines, it doesn’t seem to relieve the guilt any. At <strong><a href=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/myrtle-beach-rental-deals"">Seaside Rentals</a></strong> we get that and that’s why we have 25+ dog-friendly vacation rentals to offer where you can stay and bring your pooch, too!

<a href=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Dog_Selfie.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-561"" src=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Dog_Selfie.jpg"" alt=""Check Out These Dog Friendly Rentals"" width=""625"" height=""416"" /></a>

While your four-legged family members won’t get the same benefits of lounging by the pool or on the beach with a tall, cool drink in their hands (paws?) as you will, they’ll be over the moon happy just to be with you.

If you want a more sparsely populated beachfront on which to enjoy time with all of your family you pretty much have two options:
<ol>
	<li>Go to the beachfront early in the morning or later in the evening when the general population of beach goers aren’t there and it’s cooler out.</li>
	<li>Take your vacation during the off-season between October and April. Again, the temperatures are much cooler for walking about in a fur coat 24/7!</li>
</ol>
<a href=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DogFriendly_Rentals.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-562"" src=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DogFriendly_Rentals.jpg"" alt=""Check Out These Dog Friendly Rentals"" width=""625"" height=""416"" /></a>

When you want to go out in the heat of the day, we suggest leaving your dog – who is hopefully very well behaved – in your vacation rental to enjoy the air conditioned comfort. Dogs spend the majority of their day sleeping when you’re not around. They don’t (as some people think) sit around wringing their hands (paws?) wondering if you’ll be able to find your way back home again without their help.

567,"How to Unplug and Enjoy That Late Season Vacation","There are many families that prefer taking a late season vacation when there are less crowds, less traffic and temperatures have gone from scorching to pleasantly warm. But when it comes to vacations you and your family need to be fully present to get the most out of them. That’s hard to do when there’s a mobile device in every person’s hand. But it’s not impossible. It would be a shame to return home after a week away on vacation and have no memories because you remained plugged into your device the entire time.

<a href=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/unplug.jpg""><img src=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/unplug.jpg"" alt=""How to Unplug and Enjoy a Late Season Vacation"" width=""660"" height=""433"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-568"" /></a>

We realize it’s a lot to ask to have you and the kids leave your iPhones, iPads, iTouch and laptops at home. So why not set aside a period of time – one or two hours – each day when everyone plugs in at once to get their ""internet fix."" When the hour is up, you’re done until the next day. As a family, go out and enjoy the sandy beach and blue ocean water...but leave your mobile devices in the room!


It might feel awkward at first. You’re used to having that device in your pocket or purse. Without even realizing it, you’ve come to expect it to vibrate or ring and so you’re always on alert. But after a little while, surrounded by all this beauty, it will be the last thing on your mind as you slip ever so quietly into vacation mode.

Now think about all the things you’re freed up to do when you don’t have that wireless connection tying you down. Enjoy the miles of unspoiled sandy beaches, nature walks, and wide bike paths. Delight your children with a visit to the area parks. Spend the day out on a charter boat doing some fishing and let the kids experience catching “the big one” on their fishing line. This is how you make lasting memories! There’s plenty of golf and tennis to be played here and unlimited shopping excursions as well.

But if you plan on bringing man’s best friend with you to the beach, there are a few things you should keep in mind before you hit the sand.

<img class=""alignleft size-large wp-image-670"" src=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Untitled-design-2-1024x536.png"" alt=""dogs-on-beach"" width=""474"" height=""248"" />
<h2>Check the Rules for Dogs on the Beach</h2>
Horry County (Myrtle Beach, Surfside Beach, Garden City Beach) May 1 - Labor Day, dogs are allowed on the beach only before 10 am and after 5 pm. From Labor Day - April 30 each year, dogs are allowed on the beach at any time of day. At all times when dogs are allowed on the beach, they must be on a leash and dog owners must pick up and properly dispose of the droppings.
<h2>Make Sure Your Dog Can Swim</h2>
Don’t automatically assume your dog is a swimmer. Test out how they do in water by letting them test the waters in a shallow area. Give your pup time to acclimate, and consider letting them practice their swimming technique in a dog-friendly pool or shallow lake. Invest in a doggy life jacket for extra safety.
<h2>Bring Fresh Water and Shade</h2>
Prevent your dog from drinking saltwater by ensuring they have plenty of freshwater available to drink. Just like children, dogs need plenty of access to shade so that they don’t overheat, so grab an umbrella!
<h2>Grab the Pet Sunscreen</h2>
Many people assume that dogs are immune to sunburns because of their fur, but that isn’t the case. Purchase dog-friendly sunscreen and apply regularly if you’re spending a lot of time under the sun!
<h2>Post-Beach Showers</h2>
After letting your dog play in saltwater, be sure you rinse them off thoroughly so they don’t ingest salt from licking themselves.

<p class=""p1""><b></b>If this is the first time you've taken a vacation with a baby in tow there are some tips you should keep in mind. While it might feel like it will take a small army to manage this, it really won't. Babies have been enjoying beach vacations since the concept of a beach vacation came to be. While beach vacations are oriented more to adults and children, babies are content to be anywhere that their parents are and when you stay in our <a href=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/booking/booking-search-amenities.cfm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><b>family friendly vacation rentals</b></a> you'll have everything you need for that perfect vacation. Anything that relaxes Mom and Dad is going to make for a happy baby so stay calm throughout your time away. It’s important to remind yourselves, you’re on vacation and the goal is to have fun.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Below are some important tips that will help you and your baby enjoy this summer's beach vacation.</p>
<p class=""p3"">1. <b>Plan Your Time.</b> Try to schedule your airline flights during the normal nap time your baby is used to. Walk and play with the baby during extended periods in the airport. More energy exerted there will be less energy the baby exerts in the confines of an airplane.</p>
<p class=""p4"">2. <b>Stay On Schedule.</b> Maintain the schedule you have at home for the entire time you’re on vacation. That includes the time you wake up and go to sleep, the time you eat meals, and when nap time is. This is not the time to kick up your heels and stay out late.</p>
<p class=""p5""><span class=""s1"">3. <b>Inquire Before Leaving.</b> Make sure the place where you’re staying </span>provides sleeping arrangements for babies. Ask about cribs, play pens and<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>as the car rental agency about car seats, too.</p>
&nbsp;
<p class=""p5""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-989"" src=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ThinkstockPhotos-499629814.jpg"" alt=""babys schedule"" width=""729"" height=""479"" /></p>
<p class=""p5"">4. <b>Stay Calm. </b>Don’t stress out while getting ready for your trip because your baby will sense that and be on edge as well.</p>
<p class=""p5"">5. <b>Plan On Doing Less.</b> With babies the rule really is “Less is More.” Don’t over stimulate a baby. Make sure they take naps in quiet and comfortable spaces. Afternoon naps improve the chances of a quality evening so consider taking a nap at the same time.</p>
<p class=""p5"">6. <b>Apply Sunscreen Often.</b> Shield babies from the midday sun. Don’t count on a tent or canopy because some beaches don’t allow them. Wear hats and light weight clothing. Apply sunscreen to any areas of skin showing. Read the label and reapply as recommended.</p>
<p class=""p5"">7. <b>Beachin' it During Off Times. </b>Plan on going to the beach early or late. Don't take your baby to the beach during the hottest time of the day between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.</p>
<p class=""p6"">When you arrive at the beach with a baby in tow and are looking for the perfect <b>family friendly vacation rentals</b> don’t hesitate to give us a call at <a href=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><b>Seaside Rentals</b></a>, (866) 252-9930.

If it rains on your vacation it doesn’t have to be a wash out downer. People find things to do all the time to escape the heat and those will help you escape the rain as well. There’s many things to do on a beach vacation that doesn’t involve the beach at all! While you could stay indoors and enjoy the amenities any one of our <a href=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Seaside Rentals</strong></a> can provide you, there surely are lots more that you can do to make your vacation all that it can be.

1. Be proactive and check the weather channel on TV or weather.com online to see if it’s going to rain and how long it’s forecasted to last.
2. Take a trip to a local drug store or beach shop and pick up some umbrellas or rain gear cheaply.
3. The ocean is exciting when a storm is coming. Take a walk on the beach with your umbrella. Nix this idea if it’s thundering or lightning.
4. Go to an air conditioned indoor movie theatre.

716,"How to Plan the Perfect Beach Date","If you’ve watched any chick flick, you know that there’s nothing more romantic than a date on the beach. While the ocean makes a fantastic background for a date, there are a lot of factors involved in executing the perfect beach date. We’ll break it down for you:

<img class=""size-large wp-image-717 alignnone"" src=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Planning-The-Perfect-Beach-Date-1024x536.png"" alt=""Planning The Perfect Beach Date"" width=""474"" height=""248"" />
<h3>Check the Weather</h3>
Nothing ruins an outdoor date fast than bad weather. Be sure you consult the weatherman to ensure you pick a picture perfect day.
<h3>Pack a Picnic</h3>
You’re sure to get extra points from your date for packing a cute picnic lunch. Pack easy-to-eat foods, like sandwiches or pizza (nothing that requires utensils).
<h3>Look up the Sunset Time</h3>
Sunset over the ocean, is there anything romantic? Make sure you’re picking the perfect time of day by doing a little research and finding out what time the sun is supposed to set so you can plan accordingly.
<h3>Learn the Tide Schedule</h3>
At some places on the coast during high tide the beach can completely disappear. Do a little research on your ideal spot and check to make sure the tide won’t be a hindering factor for your date.
<h3>Bring a Jacket</h3>
Remember that beaches can be very windy! If you’re planning on holding the date during the evening, you should consider bringing a jacket (yes, even in the summer!) to avoid chill and discomfort from the wind.

755,"Sunscreen Dos and Don'ts","<strong></strong>When it comes to a person’s beach bag, everyone has a different idea of what should go inside: books, music, snacks…the list is endless. But one thing we should all be sure to have in our beach bags is sunscreen! We’ve all heard for years the importance of using sunscreen to protect us from sunburn and skin cancer, but simply slathering up isn’t enough to keep you protected from the sun.

<img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-756"" src=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sunscreen-Dos-and-Donts-1024x536.png"" alt=""sunscreen-dos-and-donts"" width=""474"" height=""248"" />

Follow these sunscreen dos and don’ts to keep your skin protected!
<h1>DO</h1>
Apply and reapply often! The recommended reapplication timeline is every 2 hours when you’re in the sun. If you spend a lot of time in the water and aren’t using waterproof sunscreen, you might want to reapply more often!

Use hats, shirts, cover ups, umbrellas, and more to keep you out of the sun as much as possible

Apply sunscreen even on a cloudy or cold day. You can still get burned even if it’s cloudy, and the temperature of the day has nothing to do with the sun’s ability to burn your skin!

Use a sunscreen that protects from both UVA and UVB rays
<h1>DON’T</h1>
Rely on your makeup’s built in SPF to be enough to keep you safe. You’re likely not applying enough or reapplying often enough for makeup to be an effective sunblock.

Assume that because you have darker skin you’re immune to the sun’s ability to burn you.

Apply sunscreen to your infant without first consulting a pediatrician

Waste money on SPFs higher than 50, as there’s no evidence to support that SPFs higher than 50 are any more effective at protecting you from the sun.

<strong>Molten Mountain</strong>
Like Cancun Lagoon, Molten Mountain also offers both an indoor and outdoor course (probably because both courses were designed by and owned by the same person!). The courses at Molten Mountain follow a more tropical theme with the outside course meandering along the base of a volcano and the indoor course winding its way through the inside of the volcano.

Beach vacations are always a blast. Sand, sun and family time. What could be better? Booking a <a href=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/"">beach rental</a> can upgrade your beach vacation from an 8 to an outstanding 10!
<h5 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Sometimes the beach can tire you out, especially if you have children.</strong></h5>
Spend too much time at the beach during the day and you just might find that the sun can become overbearing and the sand can become a nuisance. Having a beach rental can solve all of this!

Instead of spending hours upon hours at the beach, you can spread it out and go periodically throughout the day. This means you can go to the beach for a few hours in the morning, walk the rental for lunch, relax, head back out and then finish the day floating the pool!

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-795"" src=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-17-at-9.54.52-AM.png"" alt=""screen-shot-2016-11-17-at-9-54-52-am"" width=""927"" height=""530"" />
<h5 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Everyone gets their own space.</strong></h5>
Having a beach rental also means everyone can have their own space which is especially great for babies and kids. Family time is great, but sometimes everyone needs a little time to do their own thing whether this is read a book, watch TV or play. This keeps moods in check and makes family time that much better!
<h5 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Cut down on meal expenses.</strong></h5>
If you have a large family, going out to eat during vacation can become expensive. Utilizing a beach rental means you have a full kitchen that you can utilize for breakfast, lunch and dinner, cutting vacation costs tremendously.
<h5 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Enjoy your vacation as a family without the noisy distractions.</strong></h5>
Beach vacations aren’t just for families which means in typical hotel scenarios, you can find yourself surrounded by college kids in the pool or noisy groups that make getting a good night’s sleep impossible. By getting a beach rental, you cut down on the distractions and spend more time fully enjoying your vacation as a family.

Even with colder temps, here are three activity ideas your whole family will enjoy:</span>

<b>Inside Game Tournament</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before leaving for your trip to the beach, pack all of your favorite board games and card games.  Then, head to your local discount store and buy some bags of candy and anything else that can be handed out as a prize. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once you’ve reached your destination, use any downtime to play some games tournament style. If you’ve got a large family, divide into teams. Tally the winners of each game and at the end of the trip crown the winner with the prizes you bought!</span>

<b>Hot Chocolate and Cookie Night</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Staying in a beach rental gives you the luxury of a full kitchen. Use it to your advantage! Make some hot chocolate filled with marshmallows and whip cream then throw some cookies in the oven that you can decorate with icing, sprinkles and anything else your hearts desire. Once you’ve got your hot chocolate and warm cookies in hand, head out to the porch with some blankets and do some star-gazing.</span>

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-808"" src=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/christmas-cookies-553457_1280-1024x682.jpg"" alt=""christmas-cookies-553457_1280"" width=""428"" height=""285"" />

<b>Hot Soup Picnic</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once again, take advantage of that full kitchen. Make some of your kids favorite hot soup, then head out to the beach for a picnic. Once you’re done with the soup, add a football or soccer ball to the mix for a fun family sports tournament. The soup and the running around is sure to heat you up in no time!</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Spring is just a few weeks away and soon tourists will flock to the beach to soak up the sun and relax by the ocean. So, if you’re ready to escape winter and wanting to spend your spring break in Myrtle Beach, it’s time to start planning! Here’s what to think about when planning a Spring Break beach vacation.</span>
<h4><b>Who’s going?</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You’ll want a set number of who will be joining you on the trip because this is essential to deciding where to stay. If you’re joined by just a few friends, a hotel room might suffice. However, if you’re going with a larger group a</span><a href=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> beach renta</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">l is the best option. Additionally, with a large group you’ll want to check to see if everyone is comfortable sharing a room or if some in your group would prefer their own room. </span>

Pro tip: use our advanced search option to view rentals around Myrtle Beach, SC with the exact number of bedrooms you need.
<h4><b>Are you bringing your pets?</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you have pets, you may be considering bringing them with you. This could be fun, but it could also end up making you have to alter your plans. For example, your dog won’t be able to stay alone for long which means you’ll either have to enjoy only the activities that your dog can enjoy too or you’ll have to plan your day around going back to your rental to walk and play with your dog. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pro tip: if you decide to take your dog with you, use our </span><a href=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/booking/booking-search-amenities.cfm""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">search by amenities</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> option to view pet-friendly rentals near Myrtle Beach. </span>
<h4><b>Will you be driving or flying?</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’re flying, you may prefer to save on the cost of a rental car by staying in a central location that will allow you to walk to nearby activities, restaurants and shops. If you’re driving, this can offer you more options as far as location and ultimately, by not being in the town’s central hotspot, you can save a small amount of money on your rental or hotel. </span>
<h4><b>Do you want to save money by staying somewhere off the beach or are you comfortable with splurging in order to be oceanfront?</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can truly save a good amount of money by staying in a rental that’s just off of the beach, so if you’re trying to plan a Myrtle Beach spring break vacation on a budget this is your best option. If you’re not concerned with your budget and are more concerned with spending spring break with the ocean just outside your backdoor, spend a little extra for an oceanfront rental.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pro tip: you can use our </span><a href=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/booking/booking-search-advanced.cfm""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">advanced search option </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">to find rentals that are located oceanfront as well as those that are a few rows away, but still just a walk to the beach. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">These are just a few of the of the top things to consider when planning a spring break vacation, but the number one priority is simply planning early! Waiting until the last minute will leave you stressed and paying far more for far less. </span>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’re struggling to decide which beach rental home is right for you or if you’re trying to decide if a beach rental is even best for you, give us a call at:843.839.0099 </span>",,20170127,post,http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/845-2,,"Beach House Rental|Garden City Beach house rental|Grand Strand vacation|Myrtle Beach family vacation"

Myrtle Beach has become one of the top destinations in the U.S. for family vacations and enjoying a little fun in the sun. When <a href=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com"">planning your next vacation</a>, keep in mind these top 10 popular activities to do in Myrtle Beach, SC.

<strong>1. Stroll around Broadway at the Beach.</strong>
Broadway at the Beach offers some great shopping, dining, entertainment and attractions making it the perfect spot for everyone in the family to enjoy.

<strong>2. Dine at a waterfront restaurant.</strong>
While in Myrtle Beach, dining at a few waterfront restaurants is a must. To get the best view and seating, make reservations in advance for sunset. We recommend checking out The Gulfstream Cafe, Sea Captain’s House and Filet’s on the Water.

<strong>3. Late night mini golf.</strong>
During peak months, many of Myrtle Beach’s attractions stay open late which means you’ll still find families playing mini golf even at 10pm.

<strong>4. Play some arcade games.</strong>
A little fun, friendly competition is a great way to end the day and arcades offer a little something for everyone. We recommend stopping by the Garden City Pavilion and the Fun Plaza Arcade.

<strong>5. Walk along Ocean Boulevard and the Boardwalk.</strong>
There’s nothing like joining the crowds of people walking along Ocean Boulevard or the Boardwalk. Ice cream, candy, attractions and unique gift shops await!

<strong>6. Take a ride on the Myrtle Beach Skywheel.</strong>
Seeing the ocean from high atop the Myrtle Beach Skywheel is a sight you won’t easily forget. It’s a must-do activity on any Myrtle Beach trip.

<strong>7. Spend a day at a water park.</strong>
Water parks are a great break from the beach while still offering a respite from the heat. There are quite a few water parks spread throughout Myrtle Beach so it’s not hard to find one that’s perfect for your family!

<strong>8. Go ziplining.</strong>
Ziplining may seem like something you can only do in far off, exotic places, but Myrtle Beach actually has a few different zipline companies that let you see the area from a different perspective. For example, Go Ape Zip Line &amp; Treetop Adventure offers zipline adventures through the treetops of North Myrtle Beach while Soar + Explore Zip Line &amp; Rope Course lets your drift high above Broadway at the Beach and Myrtle Beach Zipline Adventures lets you fly through the sky just feet from the beach.

<strong>9. See a variety show.</strong>
Myrtle Beach is scattered with some great theatres that offer family friendly variety shows. We recommend checking out Alabama Theatre and Legends in Concert.

<strong>10. Take a sunset beach walk.</strong>
While spending the day at the beach is one of the most popular activities to do when visiting Myrtle Beach, don’t just pack up when you the sun starts to go down. Stay a little longer, walk the beach and take in the amazing sky as the sunsets. It will be a memory that will last a lifetime!

896,"Why Spend Memorial Day Weekend 2017 in a Myrtle Beach Vacation Rental","<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-897 size-large"" src=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Memorial-Day-in-MYR-1024x536.png"" alt="""" width=""474"" height=""248"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What better way to spend the Memorial Day Weekend than at the beach? Each year, families and friends flock to the coast to do just that. Haven’t quite settled on plans yet? You still have some time! </span>

Memorial Day falls this year on Monday, May 29th. With the three-day weekend, people typically make it into a mini-vacation. This particular holiday includes certain traditions, such as backyard barbecues, that are truly best carried out in a home. When you book your stay in a vacation rental, you get to have a vacation that feels like home.

<b>Renting a vacation home allows you to stay put.</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When you have a three-story oceanfront home rented out for the weekend, why would you ever have to leave? There’s something especially rejuvenating about going on vacation and truly not worrying about doing anything but simply relaxing. </span>

<b>The beach is in your backyard.</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even if your rental unit is not quite oceanfront, you will likely still be a short walk or golf cart ride away. There’s nothing better than not having to pack up the car to head to the beach.</span>

<b>All of the amenities you miss when staying at a hotel.</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Community areas to spend quality time with your family, more than one bathroom, the list could go on. The biggest perk of renting a vacation home during your Memorial Day Weekend trip is the use of a kitchen! Memorial Day at the beach simply doesn’t feel the same when you have to dine out at a restaurant instead of grill out in your backyard.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There’s still plenty of time to book your Memorial Day Weekend with friends, family or just the two of you.

912,"Things You Should Know About Beach Safety","&nbsp;

Swimming in the ocean is one of the main reasons many people visit coastal South Carolina every year. If you’re not aware of the dangers of swimming in the ocean, you can put yourself (and others) at risk. Read our top safety tips below and remember, when in doubt, don’t go out!
&nbsp;
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-913"" src=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ThinkstockPhotos-200342709-001.jpg"" alt=""Things You Should Know About Beach Safety "" width=""550"" height=""367"" />
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Do Not Swim Alone</strong>– No matter how good of a swimmer you are, it’s always safer to swim in groups.</li>
&nbsp;
 	<li><strong>Know Your Limits</strong>– If you know you’re not a strong swimmer, avoid getting in the water when wind, currents, rip tides and waves are high. Watch other swimmers enter and exit the water for at least a few minutes to know what to expect. Set your expectations realistically on how well you can swim without the aid of floatation devices and never go out farther than you can swim back.
&nbsp;
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-914 size-full"" src=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ThinkstockPhotos-94347677.jpg"" alt=""Things You Should Know About Ocean Safety "" width=""550"" height=""366"" />
&nbsp;
 	<li><strong>Ask a Lifeguard</strong>– Choose beaches that have lifeguard stations, and don’t be afraid to ask them about conditions. Hazardous conditions could include dangerous shore breaks, strong currents, high surf, shark sightings, jellyfish, man-o-war, and dangerous rip tides.</li>
&nbsp;
 	<li><strong>Be Cautious</strong>– Rip tides can drag even the strongest swimmer out into deep water. Rip currents can be recognized by a sandy discoloration and smooth water between breaking waves. Since rip tides are in proportion to the frequency and size of the waves, the larger the waves, the stronger the rip currents will be. If you find yourself caught in a rip tide, swim parallel to the shore, slowly working your way back at an angle. Do not panic and do not be afraid to signal for help.</li>
&nbsp;
</ul>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-915"" src=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ThinkstockPhotos-93574039.jpg"" alt=""Things You Should Know About Ocean Safety "" width=""550"" height=""366"" />
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Be Aware</strong>– Just because the water looks calm doesn’t always mean it is. Waves come in sets, so be aware of the tidal cycles and possible marine life around you when entering the water. Avoid swimming at night, wearing shiny jewelry and do not swim in areas that are being fished.</li>
&nbsp;
 	<li><strong>Have a Plan</strong>– Always have an entry and an exit plan from the water. Remember where you got in and try to follow a similar path. If a large wave is approaching and you don’t have time to get out of the way, try to dive beneath it or keep your body as low as possible until it passes over you.</li>
&nbsp;
 	<li><strong>Follow the Basics</strong>– Wear sunscreen, bring appropriate footwear when visiting beaches, and avoid alcohol and drugs when swimming in the ocean. Never leave children unattended. Leave before everyone is burned and you’ll be able to come back another day.</li>
&nbsp;
</ul>
Follow these guidelines and you’ll have a safe and happy time at the beach! All of us at <a href=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Seaside Rentals</strong></a> wish you and your family a very happy Summer 2017!

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you want to rub elbows with locals, try </span><a href=""http://collectorscafeandgallery.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Collectors Cafe</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. You’ll be surrounded by works of art on the walls and on your plate. We suggest the Basil Lemon Drop Martini or the Farmer’s Daughter for a cool start to your evening. The black bean cakes and sauteed calamari, scallops and shrimp are perfect noshes for a happy hour.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For the beer lover, </span><a href=""http://menu.gordonbiersch.com/myrtle-beach-menu/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gorden Biersch</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> at Market Common is a must. You can build your own flight of 6 or a get a “full pour” which is enough for two people. They have great hand-tossed pizzas and nachos for sharing, too.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For those who love to sit out on the water with the breeze in their hair, </span><a href=""https://www.thewickedtuna.com/drinks/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wicked Tuna</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in Murrells Inlet is for you. Its sprawling deck can accompany big parties and their menu offers lots of options from fried seafood to Asian-inspired fare like Ahi tuna sashimi. If you love red wine, we suggest trying the Wild Horse Unbridled Pinot Noir ($55/bottle) and if you like white, we love the fruity and light taste of the Acrobat Pinot Gris ($34/bottle).</span>

<a href=""http://www.artsushibar.com/menu22.html""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Art Burger Sushi Bar</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> might seem like a strange name and combination, but you won’t be sorry you visited. We love the liquid nitrogen drinks (they’re all the rage) and they even have edible cocktails! Did we mention they also have ocean views? Hey, they haven’t gotten 4.5 stars on Yelp for no reason!</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If casual is more your style, don’t miss the </span><a href=""http://www.atlastaphouse.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Atlas Tap House</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. They offer craft brews and bourbon drinks. Plus, if you get hungry, you can grab some barbeque. We suggest having the Two Hearted Ale, which is brewed in Michigan.

951,"4 Tips On Unplugging From Work On Your Vacation","Sometimes maintaining a work-life balance feels more like trying to juggle while riding a unicycle. Between raising children, fighting for that new promotion and trying to keep some semblance of social life, we’re desperately in need of a good beach vacation. However, many adults find it difficult to fully disconnect from the office, even while they lounge on the beach. To get the most out of your next Myrtle Beach vacation, follow these four tips on unplugging from work:

<h3>Prepare beforehand</h3>
Your vacation may be marked on the calendar, but that doesn’t mean your coworkers will remember you’ll be gone. The week before you leave, be sure to reinform everyone you work with on a regular basis that you won’t be reachable. This gives them ample time to come to you with anything that needs to get done before your trip. The day before you leave, set up your out of office email reply, stating that you won’t be able to respond until your return date. It’s your responsibility to make sure all your work is done before you leave, but it’s your coworkers responsibility to manage without you while you work on your suntan.

<h3>Schedule a time to check emails</h3>
Some people may not have the luxury of leaving their work completely unattended while on vacation. If this is you, set yourself a schedule of when you will check your email each day. Check in each morning before you and your family head out and again each evening before dinner. If absolutely necessary, give your coworkers a phone number to reach you at if there is an emergency. You’ll still be up-to-date on the happenings in your office while still enjoying the rest of your day with your family.

<h3>Turn off notifications</h3>
If your phone is buzzing at you every time you’re copied in an email, you’ll never be able to fully relax. Go into your settings and disable notifications for your work related apps. If you don’t trust yourself not to check for updates, create a folder on your home screen with work apps titled “do not open.” Remind yourself you’ll get online later in the evening to check in and don’t need to use your phone for anything but picture taking on the beach.

<h3>Remember, you deserve a vacation</h3>
Everyone deserves a break from their hard work every once in awhile. We become accustomed to balancing so many responsibilities that we often feel guilty when we stop to take time for ourselves. However, remember that you need time to relax and enjoy yourself in order to be the best coworker, parent and friend possible. The most important part of truly disconnecting from work while on vacation is acknowledging that you deserve a break. So, sit back and enjoy the sun, sand and waves with your loved ones, courtesy of <a href=""http://www.seasiderentalsonline.com/"">Seaside Rentals</a>.

A hurricane is a lot more than just a whole lot of wind. For instance, the ocean’s storm surge may extend beyond the immediate coastal areas. Hurricanes also bring high winds, tornadoes, heavy rains, and flooding to inland regions. It’s important to know how to prepare for this ahead of time.

<strong>Before the Storm</strong>

If you live or are visiting along the coast, plan an evacuation route. Stay tuned to your local television and radio stations (104.1 and 106.5 for Grand Strand area) for emergency evacuation information. Learn safe routes inland. If you are on vacation in the area talk to the hotel or resort management about their storm procedures.<strong> </strong>

<strong>During the Storm</strong>

Stay tuned to your local television and radio stations for emergency information. Keep a battery-operated, solar-powered or hand-crank-operated radio or television for use during power outages. Stay inside a well-constructed building away from windows and doors, even if they are covered. Go to an interior first-floor room, closet, or under the stairs and stay alert. Tornadoes are often spawned during hurricanes. If the “eye” of the storm passes over your area, be aware that severe conditions will return with winds from the other direction in a very short time. Limit your non-emergency phone calls. Keep calls brief to minimize network congestion. Wait at least 10 seconds before redialing a call. For non-emergencies, try text messaging from your mobile device. Once the storm passes, be patient. You will most likely not be able to return home right away.

<strong>Shelters</strong>

Emergency shelters will be opened if a hurricane approaches South Carolina. Before heading to a public shelter, first consider staying with family and friends or in a hotel out of the evacuated area. If those options are unavailable, the American Red Cross will provide a safe place to stay when you have no other place to go. Cots and blankets will only be provided in the public shelter after hurricane conditions subside. Although food may be provided, specialty items for infants and individuals on restricted diets may not be available.

<strong>Stay Connected</strong>

During a major disaster, there will be a lot of information available online at various sites. Some information will be accurate while other sources can be misleading. Check your local town or county’s website or verified social media channels to find resources such as advisories on shelters, routes, detours and road closures, ways to return home and storm clean-up information.

You can use social media from your mobile device to post your status to let family and friends know you are safe. In addition to Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and others, you can use resources such as the American Red Cross’s <a href=""https://safeandwell.communityos.org/cms/index.php"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Safe and Well Program</a> .<strong> </strong>

<strong>After the Storm</strong>

If you have evacuated, some areas may be inaccessible even after the official evacuation order is rescinded. Return only after local authorities advise it is safe to do so. Keep tuned to your local radio and TV stations and monitor social media for recovery information. Take the following precautions after the storm:
<ul>
 	<li>Avoid downed and sagging power lines.</li>
 	<li>Avoid flooded roads and washed-out bridges and roadways.</li>
 	<li>Inspect the utilities around and in your home</li>
 	<li>Beware of snakes, insects and other animals driven to higher ground by floodwater.</li>
 	<li>Let a relative know you are home</li>
 	<li>Monitor the radio, TV and social media</li>
</ul>
