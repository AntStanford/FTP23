Installing Blog CFC code on websites on our servers.
----------------------------------------------------

The main files for this blog are on our Dev server in the Code Library here:
/CodeLibrary/codeLibrary/blogcfc

Copy that etire "blogcfc" directory into their site root directory.
Then rename that directory to "blog"

Now set up the database - 
In Navicat, copy all of the database structures from the "blogcfc_new" database 
over to their database for the site.
You can find their DSN for their database by looking at their application.cfm file in the
root directory for their website. If you can't find their DSN or they don't already have
a database set up, you may need to ask Randy to add a database and datasource.

After you copy the database tables over, go in the TBLUSERS table and set their
blog admin login and password, as well as the Name field. 
This one is displayed with the blog entries so make it their business name.
I often try to make the blog login and password the same as the one for
their other website admin area.

Now in the blog directory, open the following file to edit:
org/camden/blog/blog.ini.cfm
Change the DSN to your datasource name (use the same one that is listed in their 
websites main application.cfm file)
Also change all of the other stuff to make it unique (MOSTLY ONLY THE STUFF IN BOLD NEEDS CHANGED)
Everythinge else that is blank can be left as-is. The ones that are blank can be left blank.

(if having more than one blog on a site, like if
doing subdomains, then also change the [default] at the top to
[SomeOtherName] NO HYPHENS!!!! and then go open the
application file in the blog root and change the cfset blogname
to that new name also.

May need to check in the file  /tags/textarea.cfm
that the blog directory name is specified correctly in the file basePath.
I would also change the fckEditor width down below in that file to what the actual width
of the body of their blog on their site will be (don't count the sidebar menu). That way
when they are adding or editing blog entries they will see it in the same width
as it will be when it posts to the page.

Now try to view this file in your browser (change the website and blog directory name to their actual one):
 http://website.com/BLOG-DIRECTORY-NAME/info22.php
If you get an error there you need to ask Randy to enable PHP for their website. This will enable more
backend functionality to their blog features. 

Now the blog admin area should be working on the domain.
You should be able to go to the website address for the blog admin area in your browser to finish customizing it.
 http://website.com/BLOG-DIRECTORY-NAME/admin

Go ahead and click "Add Entry" and add one initial "Welcome to..." blog entry now.
This will help you to be able to test the page layout with a blog entry in place.
For the category name, put in their main keyword phrase for their website
(Myrtle Beach real estate, Charleston hotels, Sunset Beach vacation rentals, etc).

After adding their first entry and submitting it, go ahead and add a few more categories
to their blog using about 10 more of their top keyword phrases. 
( you can leave this to Adam if you are not sure about the specific phrases to use).

Now to make the blog layout match their website you need to
grab some sample page code and paste it into this file:
/tags/layout.cfm 
I usually pick a generic page on their site like this one
http://www.dumontbrothers.com/pressrelease.cfm
so that I can copy and paste the source code before and after the blank body section
and paste it into the layout.cfm file where the pieces go before and after the
blog divs. Don't forget to also copy in any necessar stylesheet or script tags
to the head of the layout.cfm file, as well as any "body onload" info that needs
included in the body tag.

You will need to be sure that all images and page paths in the copied code are relative to the website root
(starting with a forward slash such as /imgages/top.jpg   ). The same goes with all links to CSS and script files.
Otherwise the blog links and images will all be bad.

Also, all inline color references in the code need to be escaped with a second # or they will break the CF code.
So color references need to look like this to be correct:  ##FFFOOO

If necessary, you can also rearrange the DIV's so they are arranged the way you want on the page
(for example if you are trying to put the blog sidebar into a different location such as below their existing sidebar navigation).

Next, this file needs edited to match the website style fonts and colors;
includes/style.css
and possibly this one also if the main body widths are not fitting in the page body:
includes/layout.css

When all is done and the blog is working correctly and and looks good, be sure to cross browser check it
in Firefox, IE 6, IE 7 and Safari, then let Adam know the blog is ready to roll and he will work with the
client on where they would like the links added to their site.

Thanks!
===========================

Multiple Blogs on One Domain (or subdomain blogs, etc using the same DB)

If you are adding multiple blogs on one domain, for example subdomains on
the same domain, you only have to copy all of the files over to the subdomain, then change:
/application.cfm ==> blogname
/tags/layout.cfm ==> mydirectoryname and mycityname
/org/Camden/blog/blog.ini.cfm ==> the normal bunch of stuff, including [defuault] blog name at the top.

They have made changes to this recently so you may need to have multiple user names
and user roles assigned to get this working correctly. Get ahold of Adam if you 
need help with it or get in a jam trying to get it working.
